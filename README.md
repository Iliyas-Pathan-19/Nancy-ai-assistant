# üéôÔ∏è Speech-to-Text AI Assistant

An Android application designed to act as a personal voice assistant. It leverages speech recognition to understand user commands and perform various actions‚Äîfrom making phone calls and sending messages to opening the camera and interacting with media. The assistant is built to be intuitive, responsive, and functional both online and offline for core commands.

## üîê Permissions Required

To function correctly, the app requests the following permissions:

- `RECORD_AUDIO`: Capture voice commands.
- `INTERNET` & `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`: For online recognition and network tasks.
- `READ_CONTACTS`: Search and call contacts.
- `CALL_PHONE`: Initiate phone calls.
- `CAMERA`: Open the device's camera.
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`: Access gallery media.
- `BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN`: Enable screen-locking and other admin features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology & Requirements

- **Platform**: Android
- **Languages**: Java / Kotlin
- **Core APIs**:
  - `SpeechRecognizer` for voice input
  - `TelephonyManager` & `ContactsContract` for calls and contacts
  - `Camera` & `MediaStore` intents for media access
  - `DevicePolicyManager` for admin-level control
- **Minimum SDK**: 24 (check `build.gradle`)
- **Target SDK**: 35 (as per `AndroidManifest.xml`)

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>

Ó∑ôÓ∑ö
- Open in Android Studio
Open the cloned folder in Android Studio.
- Build the Project
Sync Gradle files via File > Sync Project with Gradle Files.
- Run the App
- Connect an Android device or use an emulator.
- Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run 'app' in Android Studio.
- Grant Permissions
- Accept all requested permissions on first launch.
- Manually enable Device Admin if prompted.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- The app listens for a trigger (e.g., button press) to start SpeechRecognizer.
- Recognized speech is parsed into a string.
- Command-matching logic identifies keywords and executes corresponding actions.
- Online: Uses network-based recognition for higher accuracy.
- Offline: Uses on-device recognition for basic commands.
